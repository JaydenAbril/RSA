Giulio and I really had trouble making a while loop function that can control all of the functions such as encrypting and decrypting, but we had trouble making the while loop function in general. While using Python 3, it was more different than the Python 2 we usually use, so it was kind of in a way new because we couldn’t use an raw_input function, but we had to use a input() function. With some help with the internet and my friend, we figured out how to fix out problem and we found a solution to our while loop function. We had to make a variable, “leave” to true, and we made the while loop, “while leave == True:”
